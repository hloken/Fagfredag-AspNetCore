# Welcome to Webstep Forkus' Asp.Net Core Fagdag!
This readme will try to give you a introduction to creating and working with WebAPI controllers in Asp.Net Core.

## Your mission should you choose to accept it
The aim of the hands-on exercise is to implement a rest-based API for the booking department of the Forkus Hotel. 
This document will provide a spec of API calls with expected results and it will be up to you to implement them. 
You can then use tests to test if your implementation follows the spec.
